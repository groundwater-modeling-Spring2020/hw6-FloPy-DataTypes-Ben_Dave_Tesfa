# hw6-FloPy-DataTypes-Ben_Dave_Tesfa

Hi Guys!  Feel free to edit your python notbooks all you want!  There for testing are tutorials and making changes!  The final notebook should be when we are ready to compile all that we read, found, or did.  We should try to get a zoom meeting going if we can!

## Assignment:
For this assignment we will be dividing into groups and creating jupyter notebooks to explain key python data types.  The jupyter notebook you create will essentially be a tutorial which you will present in class and will be put into this folder as resource for everyone to refer back to. The formats may differ but for each notebook you should include the following:
 1. A brief summary of what your thing is and how we should understand it.
 2. Links for any tutorials or online explanations you found particularly helpful.
 3. A code block with an annotated list of key commands to know when working with your item (basically a quick cheat sheet we can refer back to)
 4. Walk through the properties of the item you have been assigned interspersing code and text but try not to make it too long.  I’ve provided some lists of questions your explanation should cover but this is not exhaustive so feel free to expand on what you think is useful and organize it however you feel will be most useful to others.
 5. An annotated example pulling from our course materials on where this data type gets used in our workflows, how we make it, manipulate it, use it, plot it etc.

### Other notes:
1.	One place to start for resources is the online text book we used at the start of the class: https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/thinkcspy/index.html. But also some googling might bring you to better resources for whatever item you are working on.
2.	This is a team assignment so you should just create one notebook for your group

### Data types:
#### 4. Flopy data types, head and budget files (Ben, Dave & Tesfa)
-	How do we read in these files?
-	What type of object do we have when we read it in?
-	How can we learn about the properties and variables associated with these files?
-	What are the built in flopy tools for working with these objects?
-	How do we handle the fact that they have multiple timesteps?
-	How can we extract data from these files to make plots or write to a file? (thing about both if we want to make a timeseries at a point or if we want to make a graph that is a snapshot of the whole domain at a given time).
